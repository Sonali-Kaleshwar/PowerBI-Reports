- Extracted raw sales, profit, shipment, and salesperson data from multiple data sources.
- Cleaned and structured data for analysis, including date normalization, removing duplicates, and filling missing values.
#### 2. Data Modeling:

- Created relationships between tables to ensure accurate filtering and calculations.
- Designed a star schema for optimized performance in Power BI.
#### 3. DAX Measures Creation:

- Developed custom DAX measures for KPIs such as Total Sales, Profit %, and MoM Changes.
- Ensured measures were reusable across visuals to maintain consistency.
#### 4. Visualization Design:

- Used a combination of line charts, bar charts, and KPI cards for an engaging and informative layout.

#### 5. Validation:

### DAX Measures
#### Key Performance Indicators (KPI's)
- Total Sales
Calculates the total revenue generated by summing up all sales amounts from the dataset.

        Total Sales = SUM(shipments[Sales])

- Total Boxes
Calculates the total boxes shipped

        Total boxes = SUM(shipments[Boxes])
- Total Cost
        Total cost = SUM(shipments[Sum of Cost])
- Total Profit
Subtracts the total cost from total sales to compute the net profit.
        Total Profit = [Total Sales]-[Total cost]
- Total Shipments
        Total Shipments = COUNTROWS(shipments)
- Profit %

        Profit % = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales])

- Month over Month Sales Changes

        MOM Sales Changes % = 
        var ThisMonth_sales = [Total Sales]
        var PrevMonth_sales = [Total Sales (Prev Month)]
        RETURN
        DIVIDE (ThisMonth_sales - PrevMonth_sales, PrevMonth_sales)
